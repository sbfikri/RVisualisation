# RVisualisation

This directory contains a various data visualization written in R language. I separate each folder based on project I carry out.

In TidyTuesday's folder, I copy my code and the .png project of open source internet project of @R4DSCommunity  in Twitter called TidyTuesday. The project is an inclusive participation for R programmer around the world to explore and visulaze a data compiled by @R4DSCommunity. The participant, while having fun with the data, shared their code and result in Twitter and get appreciated by the community. This project is recommended for anyone who wish to practice their data science skills through a casual manner, as there is no pressure to participate regularly or being a perfect.

The TidyTuesday is the only project so far, but there may possible be additional project I will include in this repository. Please stay tune!
